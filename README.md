# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

# milestone_2.py
The milestone_2.py file is a kind of scratchpad that lets you get started with python by performing tasks related to lists, if...else conditions and more. 

# milestone_3.py
The milestone_3.py is similar to the milestone_2.py code but enhanced. It has better readability with use of functions in the code, as well as structure is maintained. 

# milestone_4.py
The milestone_4.py has more conditions implemented for the game. Also, implementation of Class in python has been used. 

# milestone_5.py
The milestone_5.py has the full-fledged working hangman project. There still seems to be issues in the code for when the user has won or lost the game. So seems there something wrong in the function `play_game`. Needs investigation and the code could benefit from some refactoring and tweaks to make it better.
